# Explination of the TreasureHunt Project

The code includes a template of a reinforcement learning process using Q-learning and neural networks. This consists of the maze as a numpy array, classes, and methods for the game mechanics (like "TreasureMaze" and "GameExperience"), the structure of the neural network, the definition of possible actions, and some utility functions for game visualization and time format. 

The part of the code that is marked "TODO" is what I worked on. I implemented the "train" function, which is responsible for the model's training. In this function, I defined how the agent should interact with the environment, manage exploration and exploitation, remember its experiences, and learn from them. I also implemented how the training process should respond to the game's outcome with a "win or lose" based on the agent's experiences. I also implemented the criteria for terminating the training process, either when the win rate reaches a certain threshold or when all free cells are exhausted.  

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists design and innovate computer systems and tools that can solve various problems across disciplines. They're work matters because it underpins most of modern society's infrastructure, from banking to health care to entertainment, making processes efficient, secure, and accessible.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically, using an analytical mindset. First, I study and understand the problem and break it into smaller chunks and manageable tasks. I would design algorithms to solve these tasks, implement solutions, and test early and often for accuracy and efficiency. It is essential to continuously learn and adapt to use the best tools and tech.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethically, I am responsible for creating reliable, secure, and efficient solutions. I will respect the user's privacy and not misuse personal data. I will provide accessible and inclusive technology. For the organization, we should deliver quality work and use resources efficiently. You must also communicate potential ethical issues in projects, like biases in data or algorithms, and push for transparency and fairness in the designs.
